## Trends
1) Charter schools outperformed district schools in every metric, especially overall passing.  

2) There was an inverse relationship between budgeted spending and student performance, though one might expect the opposite to be the case.  Though, this could be skewed by how charter schools get their funding, since they typically had a lower per student budget, but performed much better on assessments.
